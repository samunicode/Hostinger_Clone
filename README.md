# Hostinger Clone

This project is a fully responsive clone of the Hostinger's website, which is a web hosting service provider. The purpose of this project was to enhance my skills in using Tailwind CSS, HTML, and CSS to create a website that is both visually appealing and responsive across different devices.

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid development by providing a set of pre-defined classes that can be easily applied to elements. It eliminates the need for writing custom CSS by offering a wide range of responsive utilities, such as spacing, colors, typography, and layout components. By utilizing Tailwind CSS in this project, I aimed to understand and leverage the power of this framework to create an accurate clone of the Hostinger's website.
